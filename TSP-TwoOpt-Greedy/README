            TspTwoOptGreedy(tsp)        Group 38

To build the tspTwoOptGreedy program please use the included script.
From in the directory where the source code and script are run the
command...

 "./build.sh"

 If for some reason you get a permission error first run the command...

 "chmod +x build.sh" 

Then run the previous command again. This will compile the program into 
an executable file named "tsp". From here to run the program make sure 
the input files are in the directory and run...

 "./tsp [file_name] [time_in_seconds]"

Where [file_name] is the name of the file to run and 
      [time_in_seconds] is how long the algorithms will run  

Example-> ./tsp test-input-1.txt 180 ->Runs test-input-1.txt for 180 seconds



********************************ATTENTION***********************************
Please do not use the watch.py file to interupt tsp's operation. Tsp maintains
many pointers to memory that need to be cleaned up on exit. Instead just use 
the included feature of selecting a time length when running. This method will 
always quit tsp at the chosen time no matter the input size. If for some 
reason you do need to quit early during operation just raise a sig_int using 
"Ctrl c", tsp has a signal handler to clean up it's memory in this situation.
